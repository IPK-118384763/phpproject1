		<p> I visited England back in 2013 with my Family  . We stayed in London for most of the trip.</p>
		<p>London was unlink any city I had visited before it was</p>
		<p>bustling with people and it was sometimes quite difficult to navigate around. </p>
		<p>We did most of the famous tourist attractions of London like riding the</p>
		<p>London eye, Seeing Big Ben and Buckingham Palace. I found that travelling by the tube was the easiest way to get around. </p>

		<p> I visited the Algarve region of Portugal. I stayed in the coastal city of Albufeira. </p>
		<p> Albufeira was a beautiful city. I was very lucky because the hotel I stayed in was close to both the old and new town of Albufeira. </p>
		<p> The hotel was not only close to the town but also had it's own pool for the guests. </p>
		<p> Albufeira also had beautiful beaches that I often visited.</p>

		<p> I tried loads of local food and I loved the dish called esqueixada de bacallà which is shredded salted cod on bed of tomatoes,</p> 
		<p>red peppers, onions and olives with an olive oil dressing. The city was really busy but everything is really close. I visited  </p>
		<p>La Sagrada Familia temple, The Font Mágica Fountain, Picasso Museum, and the Las Ramblas street</p>
